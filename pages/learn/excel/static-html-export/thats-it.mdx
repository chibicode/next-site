};

## That's It

Thatâ€™s all for the [static HTML export](https://nextjs.org/docs#static-html-export) feature of Next.js. You can run `npm run dev` while developing your app, and when it's time to deploy the app, you can export it as a static app.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
