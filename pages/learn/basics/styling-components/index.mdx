Letâ€™s add some some styles to our app. Next.js has _built-in_ support for the following styling methods:

1. Importing global CSS and component-level CSS Modules files using `import`
2. Writing CSS inside a component using `styled-jsx`

Weâ€™ll take a look at each method in this lesson.

> Next.js supports other styling solutions. For example, you can use CSS-in-JS libraries such as [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) or write CSS in [Sass](https://github.com/zeit/next-plugins/tree/master/packages/next-sass). Take a look at [our documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support) to learn more.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
