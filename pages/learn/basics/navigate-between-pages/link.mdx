## Link is Just a Wrapper Component

Actually, the title prop on the `Link` component has no effect. That's because `Link` is just a wrapper component which only accepts `href` and some similar props. If you need to add props to it, you need to add them to its child. In this case, the child of the `Link` component is the anchor tag.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
