import Layout from '../../../../components/learn/Layout';

export const meta = {
  title: 'Navigate Between Pages',
  courseId: 'basics',
  lessonId: 'navigate-between-pages'
};

In this lesson, you’ll learn how **page navigation** works in Next.js.

### Setup (Optional)

**If you’re continuing from the previous lesson,** you can skip the following and go straight to the next page.

Otherwise, you can download, install, and run the starter code below. Again, this is NOT necessary if you’ve just finished the previous lesson.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zeit/next-learn-demo.git
cd next-learn-demo
cd 1-navigate-between-pages
npm install
npm run dev
```

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
