## Post Page

We’d like to create a blog app, so let’s create a **post page**. We’ll use this page to demonstrate how page navigation works in Next.js.

- First, create a new directory called `posts` inside the `pages` directory.
- Inside the `posts` directory, create a file called `first-post.js` with the following content:

```jsx
const FirstPost = () => <h1>First Post</h1>;

export default FirstPost;
```

You can view this page by going to [http://localhost:3000/posts/first-post](http://localhost:3000/posts/first-post) in the browser.

This is how you can create different pages in Next.js. Simply create a JS file under the `pages` directory, and the path to the file becomes the URL path. In a way, this is similar to building websites using HTML or PHP files.

Now, let’s add a link to each page so you can go back and forth between the index page and the post page.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
