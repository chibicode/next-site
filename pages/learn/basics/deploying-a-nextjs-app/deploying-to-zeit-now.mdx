## Deploying to ZEIT Now

Next, create an account on ZEIT Now and import your GitHub repository.

1. [Sign up to ZEIT Now](https://zeit.co/signup) (no credit card is required).
2. After signing up, set up a GitHub integration. [Here are the detailed instructions](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/git-integrations/zeit-now-for-github).
3. Once that’s set up, import your Next.js app from GitHub. It auto-detects that your app is using Next.js and sets up the build configuration for you. No need to change anything — everything just works!
4. After importing, it’ll deploy your Next.js app and provide you with a deployment URL. Click **“Visit”** to see your app in production.

Congratulations! You’ve just deployed your Next.js app!

To learn more, take a look at:

- [Next.js Deployment Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment)
- [ZEIT Now Documentation](https://zeit.co/docs)

That’s all for the basics lesson. Thank you for trying out Next.js!
