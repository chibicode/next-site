## Deploying to ▲ZEIT Now

If you haven’t already done so, push your Next.js app to a Git provider of your choice: GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Your repository can be private or public.

Then, follow these steps:

1. [Sign up to ZEIT Now](https://zeit.co/signup) (no credit card is required).
2. After signing up, you’ll arrive on the [“Create a new project”](https://zeit.co/new) page. Under “From your existing code”, choose the Git provider you use and set up an integration. (Instructions: [GitHub](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/git-integrations/zeit-now-for-github) / [GitLab](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/git-integrations/zeit-now-for-gitlab) / [BitBucket](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/git-integrations/zeit-now-for-bitbucket)).
3. Once that’s set up, click “New Project From …” and import your Next.js app. It auto-detects that your app is using Next.js and sets up the build configuration for you. No need to change anything — everything just works!
4. After importing, it’ll deploy your Next.js app and provide you with a deployment URL. Click “Visit” to see your app in production.

Congratulations! You’ve just deployed your Next.js app! To learn more, take a look at:

- [Next.js Deployment Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment)
- [ZEIT Now Documentation](https://zeit.co/docs)

That’s all for the basics lesson. Thank you for trying out Next.js!
